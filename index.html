    <h1>Digital Pulse Oximeter (DPO)</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        For the final project, we want to design a Digital Pulse Oximeter (DPO) that can measure a person's blood oxygen saturation level (SpO2).
        This is vital for monitoring patients with conditions affecting their blood oxygen levels, such as asthma, pneumonia, 
        and COVID-19. DPO can detect hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels) before it becomes dangerous. This early 
        detection is crucial, especially in emergencies, such as monitoring patients with respiratory or cardiovascular conditions.
         Beyond clinical settings, DPO can also be used in fitness and wellness contexts, such as by athletes training at high
          altitudes or in other specialized conditions to ensure safe and effective training regimes. DPO provides a non-invasive way to monitor the oxygenation of a patient's hemoglobin. This can reduce the chance of a user getting infection and decrease the pain feeling. 
          Usually, a sensor is placed on a part with a thin skin layer of the patient's body, such as a fingertip.

    <h2>Why These Requirements?</h2>
    <p>
        We choose these requirements to make our product compact, portable, and easy to use, making them accessible 
        not only in hospitals but also in community clinics, ambulances, and home care settings.
        For the circuit component, we want to amplify the current signals from the two photodiodes and use the light attenuation differences to calculate the 
        blood oxygen level. We also want to filter sensor noise, and circuit noise as much as possible to make our readings accurate and stable. Finally, the data we want to 
        calibrate the coefficients in the calculation to make the readings more accurate.

            Circuit characterization:
            <ul>
                <li>
                  LM324 active filter circuit experimental gain is 1/2 of the theoretical gain, resulting in smaller than expected signal amplitudes, unsolved.
                </li>
                <li>
                  LM324 R trans-impedance circuit output is noisy, solved by additional filtering (a 4.7 uF capacitor parallelly to the feedback resistor).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Combined input/output offset voltage of LM324 and UA741 resulting negative DC offset at output, solved by digital filtering and adding calibrated offsets in LabVIEW.

            Sensors:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Unstable LED connection to the circuit, solved by soldering the LEDs to jumper cables.
              </li>
              <li>
                Photo-resistors behave non-ideally, solved by adding a filtering stage at transimpedance circuit.
              </li>

          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            LabVIEW Program:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Digital Filtering (Butterworth 4th order) results in large oscillations at the beginning of the filtered signal, solved by removing the first 30% of the filtered signal.
              </li>
              <li>
                Peak detection cannot reliably detect pulses due to the artifacts, solved by doing FFT and frequency analysis to obtain heart rate (heart rate = frequency of max power in power spectrum * 60).
              </li>
              <li>
                The nonlinear equation we proposed previously (involves log10(ratio)) cannot reliably obtain the SpO2 levels, solved by switching to the empirical linear approximation of the illuminance ratio. The illuminance ratio between two wavelengths needs to be normalized against their offset, details discussed in the design notes.
              </li>
              <li>
                The offsets of the input voltages from the circuit cannot represent the DC portion of the compartmentalized finger optical model.
              </li>



              Ideally, the Peak-Peak amplitudes of the input voltages (R and IR) are the AC component, and the offset is the DC component. However, due to input/output offsets and digital filtering. The offset does not represent the DC component. Thus, additional calibration is required to manually apply offsets to both channels. Solved by calibration with respect to a commercial pulse oximeter product.
          </ul>
          </li>

              <li>
                Our project cannot measure and display continuously, could be solved by using a producer-consumer loop in LabVIEW design.
              </li>
              <li>
                The channel offsets are not calibrated against the gold standard.
              </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      To make our design function as other commercial products, we need to make the following improvements in the future.
      First, we can make our DPO transmit data remotely, aiding in telemedicine and remote patient monitoring, which became particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic.
      ¬†     Second, we can make the product more portable using integrated circuits rather than bread-board circuits.
      ¬† Finally, we can modify the circuit or upgrade our electronic parts to get better-filtered signals, which can make the measurements more accurate and stable.
